<milki> IrcMyLife is a pseudo-blog
<milki> Posts are generated from IRC, tracking everything I say (without context)
<milki> The posts are editted for content and censored appropriately to remove any personal identifying information
<milki> As with any online content and especially public venues like IRC, all content here should not be interpreted seriously
<milki> This project was born from the simple I idea that I should publish what I type on IRC somehow
<milki> I tend to produce large blocks of monologues on IRC, as you can see from the posts on this blog
<milki> That was a couple years ago
<milki> I've now taken the idea to produce IrcMyLife
<milki> This pseudo-blog is a demonstration integrating
<milki> IRC, eggdrop, git, gitolite, dpaste, and JQuery
<milki> a complex, semi-hands-free blog generator
<milki> Logs are generated from IRC and stored in git
<milki> Using dpaste and dulwich, I can edit the logs
<milki> Finally, JQuery pulls the requested posts onto the webpage
<milki> The components of this system are published at my github
<milki> Eggdrop tcl script, dpaste
<milki> If you stick around, you might get a glimpse of what milkiness is all about
